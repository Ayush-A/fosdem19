### Overview

Quantum computing is a new emerging field that coming out of the lab and
finding its applications in the real world. The space of the open source
software for quantum computing is blooming with this trend, with researchers
and hardware providers alike investing in creating software infrastructure
for this new computing paradigm.

With that in mind, the purpose of this devroom is twofold:

- to flatten down the learning curve and break perceived barriers that prevent
  developers from entering the field of quantum software development
- to ensure that the field is dominated by high-quality, community driven FOSS
  open source software, standards and protocols

Many of the players have open sourced libraries to build quantum computing
circuits and interact with their platforms, both actual hardware and simulators.
However, not enough attention is given to building a wider quantum computing
community and current trajectory leads to multiple silos, projects that are
driven by commercial interest without liberal community driven governance
structure.

FOSDEM is one of the largest gatherings of open source community in the world,
which happens yearly at the ULB Capus Solbosch, Brussels, Belgium. As such, it
is an ideal place not only to showcase and discuss new ideas and developments
in the space of quantum computing, but also help break down the barriers in
adopting quantum computing by software developers.
