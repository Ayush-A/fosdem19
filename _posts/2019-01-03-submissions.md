We encourage both talks and workshop formats. We suggest following durations,
including questions:
- 20 min - lighting talks
- 45-60 min - talks
- 90-120 min - workshops

Note that the talks at FOSDEM are captured (and streamed) under the CC-BY
licence. Speakers are hence required to give permission to being recorded.

Submit proposals either using the FOSDEM submission system:

Pentabarf instructions: To submit your talk, click on "<em>Create Event</em>" and then
select the "<em>Quantum computing</em>" as the "<em>Track</em>". If you have already spoken at
FOSDEM previously, please re-use your account.
