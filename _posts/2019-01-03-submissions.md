We encourage both talks and workshop formats. We suggest following durations,
including questions:
- 20 min - lighting talks
- 45-60 min - talks
- 90-120 min - workshops

Note that the talks at FOSDEM are captured (and streamed) under the CC-BY
licence. Speakers are hence required to give permission to being recorded.

Submit proposals either using the FOSDEM submission system:

    https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM19
    or using email address: fosdem19 at qosf.org

Submission deadline is Dec 11th, 23.59 UTC. Speakers will be notified on Dec
13th and schedule will be made public on Dec 15th.

Pentabarf instructions: To submit your talk, click on "Create Event" and then
select the "Quantum computing" as the "Track". If you have already spoken at
FOSDEM previously, please re-use your account.
